Remarks:
- The certificate pulled from marlove.net is invalid and the CN does not match 
  (and is api.remotephone.app). For that reason I was unable to switch on SSL pinning.
  It is implemented, but currently disabled.

- I have 3 Core Data tests. But there's some issue with the entity description.
  I've tried many things according to StackOverflow posts, but I seem to be
  running in circles.

- I could have made tests of other parts of the app instead, but I'm running out of
  time. If this work is not sufficent proof I'm worth it, then leave it.
